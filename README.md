Each set of player cards comes with 15 position players and 15 pitchers. Also included are quick setup cards for pitchers and hitters. Using these cards will help you quickly set lineups with the players who figured most prominently in each team's season. 

### Dice
On Base utilizes 3 dice for gameplay: 2 d6 and 1 d9. A d9 is a bit unusual so there are a couple of options. One is to roll virtual dice. We created a little dice roller application that you can access via the Web on any device. It has all the dice needed to play On Base. Get the dice roller here:

### Scorecard
You can download and use any scorecard for this game. A pen and paper will work, as well.

## Super Basic Gameplay
The most basic way to get started is with 2 d6s and the game enchine chart. Compare the batter's WAR with the pitcher's WAR. The highest WAR value is in control of the at-bat. Roll the dice. Each die value is read on its own with the lowest number coming first. So if one die has a value of 1 and the second has a value of 6 then we read it as 16 (not 7). Go to the 16 row on the game chart and find where it intersects with the pitcher or batter WAR value (whoever is in control of the at-bat). Mark the result on your scorecard. Rinse, repeat.
