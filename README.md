Each set of player cards comes with 15 position players and 15 pitchers. Also included are quick setup cards for pitchers and hitters. Using these cards will help you quickly set lineups with the players who figured most prominently in each team's season. 

### Dice
On Base utilizes 3 dice for gameplay: 2 d6 and 1 d9. A d9 is a bit unusual so I've created a dice rolling application that you can use on any device with a web browser. It has all the dice needed to play On Base. Get the dice roller here:

### Scorecard
We've created a scorecard that is tailor-made for On Base. It includes places for WAR and Spd values to provide a quick reference during the game. However, you can use any scorecard for this game. A pen and paper will work, as well. The download for the scorecard is above.

## Basic Gameplay
The most basic way to get started is with the dice roller app and the game enchine chart. Roll the dice. The blue die will tell you whether or not the batter or pitcher has control of the at-bat. A value of 1-3 means you'll read the results off the batter side of the chart while a 4-6 means you'll read the result off the pitcher side. Next, read the value of each d6. The two values are combined to make a two-digit number with the lowest number coming first. So if one die has a value of 1 and the second die has a value of 6 then we read it as 16 (not 7). If the batter has control of the at-bat, you would go to the batter side of the chart, find the 16 row and cross reference it with the player's WAR value range. Mark the result on your scorecard. Rinse, repeat.
